# hello-world
I am learning GitHub. Currently i am doing the Hello World tutorial from GitHub Docs.

I am progressing with learning Git and GitHub, but unfortunately this happens very slowly. I wish, this to happen more faster,
because i have a lot of things to learn, and this slow pace is prolongin the time needed for successfully learning Java programming.
